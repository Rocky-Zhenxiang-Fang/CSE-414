The experience of using Azure is good. I enjoied the more modern GUI comparing to DBBrowser that I used for my previous assignments. There are still dome inconvinent part comparing to local database, such as the longer excute time. Offering a DBMS as a service in  a public cloud is a great idea since more and more data is comming out today, the convinence for people to access data in real time will be more important then before.
